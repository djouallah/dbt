# Working in this repo

One dbt project, four engines (`duckrun`, `iceberg`, `dwh`, `spark`), one landed copy of the
data. The thesis is *the engine doesn't matter, the output does* — so the models are written
per dialect (`models/duckdb`, `models/dwh`, `models/spark`, gated by `+enabled` in
`dbt_project.yml`) and one neutral DuckDB suite grades all four outputs by reading them through
Delta on OneLake.

The traps below have all been hit for real. Each one cost a CI run or worse.
[LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) records the longer investigations behind some of them — measured
numbers, and the routes that were tried and did not work.

## Verify locally before you push — CI is the last check, not the first

CI here is slow, serialized on a concurrency group, and burns paid Fabric compute. It is not a
syntax checker. Before pushing a model change, render it and read the SQL:

```bash
python - <<'EOF'
import re, jinja2
class T:
    def __init__(s, n): s.name = n
MODELS = [("models/duckdb/marts/fct_summary.sql", "duckrun"),
          ("models/duckdb/marts/fct_summary.sql", "iceberg"),
          ("models/spark/marts/fct_summary.sql",  "spark"),
          ("models/dwh/marts/fct_summary.sql",    "dwh")]
for path, tgt in MODELS:
    src = open(path, encoding="utf-8").read()
    for inc in (True, False):
        for reb in ("0", "1"):
            out = jinja2.Environment().from_string(src).render(
                config=lambda **k: "", ref=lambda n: f"tbl_{n}", this="tgt",
                is_incremental=lambda: inc, var=lambda n, d=None: d,
                env_var=lambda n, d=None: reb if n == "REBUILD_SUMMARY" else d,
                target=T(tgt))
            first = next((l for l in out.splitlines()
                          if l.strip() and not l.strip().startswith("--")), "")
            glued = [l for l in out.splitlines() if re.search(r"--.*\bWITH\b", l)]
            ok = first.strip().upper().startswith("WITH") and not glued
            print(f"{'ok ' if ok else 'BAD'} {tgt:8s} incr={inc!s:5s} REBUILD={reb} "
                  f"-> {first.strip()[:60]!r}")
EOF
```

It prints a verdict per branch, not a wall of header comments — the thing you're checking is
that SQL starts at a bare `WITH`, never glued onto a `--` line. Render **every** branch:
`is_incremental()` both ways, each target, and any env-var switch. A branch you didn't render
is a branch you didn't test. On the spark daily models that also means both an empty and a
non-empty `spark_new_files` list, and asserting on the rendered `pre_hook` — they select
genuinely different SQL, not just different text.

Two Jinja bugs this has caught that the `-%}` rule alone does not describe: a trimming comment
between `FROM text.\`path\`` and a following `WHERE` glues them into `` …`path`WHERE ``, and
Jinja comments **do not nest** — writing the trimming tokens inside a `{# … #}` closes it early
and leaks the prose into the SQL.

When a build does fail, the job uploads `target/` as an artifact. Read the *compiled* SQL
instead of guessing at the error:

```bash
gh run download <run-id> -R djouallah/dbt -n dbt-target-dwh -D /tmp/t
cat /tmp/t/compiled/aemo_electricity/models/dwh/marts/fct_summary.sql
```

## Jinja whitespace control will comment out your SQL

Every model starts with `-- depends_on:` line comments. A tag closed with `-%}` strips the
newlines *after* it, so the next SQL keyword gets pulled onto that comment line and vanishes:

```
-- depends_on: [dbt_dwh].[landing].[fct_price_today]WITH
```

The parser then reports an error at the *first CTE name*, which sends you hunting for a SQL
problem that doesn't exist. Real symptom seen: `Incorrect syntax near 'scada_cutoff'`.

**Rule:** the last Jinja tag before SQL closes with `%}`, never `-%}`. The spark
`fct_price`/`fct_scada` models carry the same warning inline — heed it rather than tidying it
away.

## Incremental write strategies are per engine, and not interchangeable

**Nothing writes with `append` any more, and nothing should go back to it.** Append has no
write-time key check, so the only thing preventing duplicate rows was the *file selection* —
`new_source_files` on dwh, `spark_new_files` on spark, the `SET VARIABLE` pre-hook on duckdb.
That list is computed **before** the write. Two overlapping runs (a re-dispatch, a `dbt retry`
racing a scheduled run) both see a file as new and both append it. The file lists all stay —
they are what keeps the merge source small — but the key match is now the guard underneath.

Every fact model is **insert-only** where the adapter can express it: the data is append-only,
so a matched row never needs updating.

| target | strategy | why not something else |
|---|---|---|
| `duckrun` | `insert` on the facts, `merge` on `fct_summary` | `insert` *is* delta-rs insert-only merge (`insert_only=True`), OCC-fenced on the version the model read — a concurrent commit fails with `CommitFailedError` rather than duplicating. Not `merge` + `when_matched do_nothing`: duckrun's clause translator accepts only `update`/`delete` and **raises** on `do_nothing` (`_specs_from_merge_clauses`). Not `delete+insert`: in this adapter that is a fenced **full-table overwrite** — every surviving target row plus the batch into a DuckDB temp table, then overwrite. On a 143M-row table that is a full rewrite *every run*. |
| `iceberg` | `merge` + `when_matched: do_nothing` | The OneLake Iceberg REST catalog rejects a matched-UPDATE branch: `BadRequest 400`, one add-snapshot update per commit. Omitting `when_matched` is not the same as insert-only — dbt-duckdb defaults it to update-by-name and draws the 400. |
| `spark` | `merge` + `skip_matched_step=true` | dbt-fabricspark honours `skip_matched_step`, which omits the WHEN MATCHED branch entirely — genuinely insert-only, and it cannot hit a multiple-source-row match error because there is no matched clause. Requires `file_format='delta'`. `merge` and `append` take the identical path in that materialization (persistent `__dbt_tmp` view, then one DML), so switching strategy does not disturb the CSV read. |
| `dwh` | `merge` on the facts, `delete+insert` on `fct_summary` | Insert-only is **not expressible** here: dbt-fabric merge is `default__get_merge_sql`, which always emits `WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET <every column>` (`merge_update_columns=[]` is falsy and falls through to all columns). For append-only data that branch is a semantic no-op — a matched row is rewritten with its own values — so it is correct, just not free. If the leg gets slow, fall back to `delete+insert` on `unique_key=['[file]']`. Bracket every key column: dbt interpolates them raw into the ON clause and `file`/`date` are reserved words. Never `--full-refresh` here: on dbt-fabric that DROPs and recreates, which deadlocks Fabric's background stats maintenance, loses grants, and rebinds Direct Lake. Use `REBUILD_SUMMARY=1` instead. |

Concurrency is not equal across the four. duckrun, iceberg and spark check the commit, so a real
overlap **fails loudly** instead of duplicating. Fabric Warehouse does not: under snapshot
isolation two transactions overlapping in time can still both insert. Merge shrinks that window
from *[compile-time file list → write]*, which is unbounded, down to the transaction overlap, and
T-SQL offers nothing stronger without application locks Fabric DW lacks.
`assert_fct_price_grain` / `assert_fct_scada_grain` are the detector for the remainder — both are
scoped to a rolling 30-day window and deliberately **not** tagged `heavy`, because the CI test job
runs `--exclude tag:heavy` and a tagged tripwire would never fire.

Before changing a strategy, read the adapter's own source rather than assuming the name means
what it does elsewhere. duckrun's lives in `dbt/adapters/duckrun/delta_plugin.py`; the Fabric ones
in `dbt/include/fabric{,spark}/macros/materializations/models/incremental/`.

### A keyed merge reads the target — prune it with LITERAL values or it reads all of it

Moving the facts off `append` made every run scan `fct_scada`/`fct_price` looking for key
collisions. On OneLake that is a full-table parquet read: the duckrun leg died on a single GET
that sat 212s and failed, three attempts running, while the other three engines passed.

Measured against delta-rs, 60-file table, merging one new file:

| predicate | target files scanned |
|---|---|
| key only | 60 / 60 |
| key + `target.DATE = source.DATE` | 60 / 60 |
| key + `target.month_key = source.month_key` | 60 / 60 |
| …same, table partitioned by `month_key` | 60 / 60 |
| key + a **literal** filter | **0 / 60** |

**A column-to-column predicate prunes nothing, and `partition_by` does not rescue it** — delta-rs
cannot know the source's range when it chooses target files. Only literals prune. The duckrun
integration-test model's `incremental_predicates=['target.month_key = source.month_key']` reads
like the lever but is not what makes it fast; don't copy it expecting pruning.

`macros/pending_file_predicate.sql` builds the real thing from the pending file names, which are
already known at compile time: `IN (...)` up to 200 files, else `BETWEEN min AND max`. Because
`file` leads every fact's `unique_key`, the predicate is *implied* by the merge ON clause — it
removes no match the key would have made. The race is still caught: on a deliberate duplicate,
1/60 files scanned and 0 rows inserted.

Write it with dbt's `DBT_INTERNAL_DEST` alias, never `target.`. dbt-duckdb (iceberg) builds its ON
clause with `DBT_INTERNAL_DEST` and knows no `target` alias, so `target.file` fails that leg
outright; duckrun rewrites `DBT_INTERNAL_DEST` → `target` itself before calling delta-rs.

## `fct_summary` must be a pure function of its inputs

It once held three different row counts across four engines while every input table was in
exact parity. Cause: the incremental source only ever offered dates missing *entirely*, so a
date that existed but was incomplete could never be repaired by any write strategy — each
engine's run history got fossilized into its table.

Rules that keep it honest:

- The incremental source emits the **complete recomputation** for every date that could still
  be stale — never a partial top-up.
- The stale set is: dates absent from the target, plus a **trailing 7-day window**, plus dates
  still in the intraday feed. The window is not "the newest daily date": if a run is missed,
  two daily files land at once and the older one's craters would be unreachable.
- **The rebuild window must be ≥ the window `assert_fct_summary_matches_recomputation`
  checks.** A test that inspects a date the model may not repair holds CI red until someone
  runs `--full-refresh` by hand. Widen both together or neither.
- Repair lever: `dbt run --full-refresh -s fct_summary` on the merge engines,
  `REBUILD_SUMMARY=1` on dwh.

## Where the DuckDB fold runs

Always in a Fabric notebook, via `fabric_run.py` → `duckrun.run_python` → `fabric_build.py`.
There is no runner-side branch and nothing decides placement.

Two attempts at deciding it are already buried, so don't dig up a third:

1. *"Did a new daily file land this run?"* — describes the download, not the backlog. A
   from-scratch lakehouse has ~3000 files outstanding with nothing new landed; that reads as 0
   and puts the whole archive on a 7GB runner.
2. *Count pending files per engine* (`pending_files.py`, deleted) — measured the right thing but
   had to read the backlog through the very tables the build was about to write. When
   `landing.fct_scada` in `dbt_delta` went unreadable, the probe threw, the aborted DuckDB
   transaction poisoned every later probe, and it fell back to its sentinel anyway.

Both failed the same way: placement is a prediction made before the build, and a wrong one is
paid for by the leg that can least afford it. Fabric handles a fold of any size; the runner
handles a small one slightly cheaper. That trade was never worth a decision that could be wrong.

`fabric_build.py` stays location-agnostic — it resolves its own token either side — so you can
still run it by hand to reproduce a CI failure. That is a debugging affordance, not a CI path.

## Facts that are easy to get wrong

- **XTable *does* convert Iceberg positional deletes** into Delta deletion vectors. Emitting
  deletes is not what forces `iceberg` to stay insert-only; the REST catalog's 400 on
  matched-UPDATE is.
- **Livy compute is workspace-side.** Change the workspace Spark pool to resize a session. The
  HC acquire payload does accept `numExecutors`/`executorCores` and the adapter forwards them
  from `spark_config`, so "cannot" is untested rather than proven — but nothing here sets them,
  and the observed 1-executor launch is the pool's dynamic-allocation floor, not a cap (it
  scaled to 9 under load).
- **Deleting a table's folder does not delete the table.** dbt asks the catalog, not storage.
  A `Tables/<schema>/<name>` directory removed by hand leaves the entry behind, `is_incremental()`
  stays true, and the model emits DML against nothing —
  `[DELTA_TABLE_NOT_FOUND]` on spark, `Catalog Error … does not exist` on duckrun. Use
  `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <schema>.<name>`. A directory holding parquet with no `_delta_log` is
  the same trap from the other direction.
- **String join keys must be whitespace-clean, and only a test can guarantee it.** T-SQL pads on
  comparison (`'ERB01' = 'ERB01 '` is TRUE); DuckDB and Spark do not. One trailing space in
  `dim_duid.DUID` put a real unit in `dwh` and in none of the other three, for a year, silently
  — and the row-count gap it produced accused the one engine that was correct.
  `assert_duid_has_no_whitespace` guards it; any new string key crossing engines needs the same.
- **The neutral reader cannot grade another engine's rounding.** `DOUBLE → DECIMAL` tie-breaking
  differs per dialect — Spark HALF_UP, DuckDB HALF_EVEN, T-SQL a third — so a test asserting a
  DuckDB recomputation *exactly* equals a stored value can only ever pass for `duckrun`. The
  symptom is ±0.0001 on a few hundred rows and no row-count difference at all. Row counts are
  dialect-independent; assert those exactly and give the sums a tolerance. See
  [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md).
- **Query the lakehouses directly before instrumenting CI.** `duckrun.connect(<abfss Tables
  path>, read_only=True)` works from a laptop against any of the four items and answers
  schema/row/value questions in minutes. Several CI round trips were spent not doing this.
- **`threads` on the spark target must stay ≤ 4.** dbt-fabricspark defaults to high concurrency
  and opens one Spark REPL per thread; Fabric packs at most five REPLs per Livy session, so more
  threads means a second Spark application, separately billed, for one `dbt run`.
- **Spark cannot read CSV with an explicit schema from a path in SQL.** `USING csv` exists only
  on `CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW`, and a temp view is unreachable from the persistent `__dbt_tmp`
  view the incremental path builds. It *is* reachable from the bare `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT`
  that the first-build and `--full-refresh` paths use, which is why `fct_price`/`fct_scada`
  carry two different reads. See [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) for the routes already ruled out —
  `csv.\`path\``, external CSV tables, `read_files()`, Python models — so they don't get retried.
- Scripts writing to `$GITHUB_ENV` / `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` must keep stdout clean —
  diagnostics go to stderr, and library chatter gets fenced with `redirect_stdout(sys.stderr)`.

## CI etiquette

- Cancel superseded runs immediately (`gh run cancel <id>`) — spark and Fabric legs cost money.
- Pushing to `main` triggers a run. If you want a dispatch with inputs instead, cancel the push
  run first; the concurrency group is not `cancel-in-progress`.
- Jobs no longer cancel the run when they fail, and no matrix is `fail-fast`. Every leg runs to
  its own conclusion, so `gh run view <id> --json jobs` reads straight: `failure` means that
  leg failed. Cancelling never saved the Fabric compute anyway — the notebook or Livy session
  keeps running workspace-side after the GitHub job dies — it only erased the evidence.
- `summary` has no `if: always()`. It compares all four engines side by side, so it runs only
  when every leg is green; a summary with holes in it reads as drift that isn't there.
- Build jobs never run tests — the engine must not grade its own homework. Testing is a
  separate job with one neutral reader.
