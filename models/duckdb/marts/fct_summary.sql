-- Determinism contract: same inputs => same summary, on every engine, regardless of that
-- engine's run history. Every run emits the COMPLETE recomputation -- the same SQL as a full
-- refresh -- for exactly the dates whose stored content could still be stale, and the write
-- reconciles that batch key by key. A partial top-up would fossilize gaps forever.
--
-- The one model here that is NOT insert-only: a re-emitted row may carry REVISED mw/price and
-- must overwrite. duckrun merges (update matched); iceberg cannot (its catalog 400s on a
-- matched UPDATE) and so only fills craters. Not delete+insert on duckrun: that adapter
-- implements it as a fenced full-table overwrite, i.e. 143M rows every run.
--
-- No merge path DELETES a row the recomputation stops producing, which is why dispatch_duids
-- below gates the intraday branch to units the daily branch can reproduce.
-- assert_fct_summary_matches_recomputation applies the SAME filter and is the tripwire -- the
-- two must always change together. Full story: LEARNINGS.md, "Two branches of one model, two
-- different unit universes"; CLAUDE.md, "fct_summary must be a pure function of its inputs".
